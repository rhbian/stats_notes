\section{t Distributions}
\begin{definition}{t Distributions}{}
Consider two independent random variables Y and Z, such that Y has the χ 2 distribution with m degrees of freedom and Z has the standard normal distribution. Suppose that a random variable X is deﬁned by the equation
\begin{equation}\label{}
X = \dfrac{Z}{(\dfrac{Y}{m})^{1/2}}
\end{equation}
Then the distribution of X is called the t distribution with m degrees of freedom.
